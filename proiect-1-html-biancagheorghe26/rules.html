      The history of tennis can be traced back to 12th-century France when it

      <h2>Tennis shots</h2>
      Tennis players use a variety of angles, speed and technique to hit the ball in a certain direction or to deceive their opponents to win a point. 
Some common tennis strokes are as follows:
<h3>Forehand and backhand</h3>

The two most common shots in tennis are the forehand and backhand. 
If a right-handed player extends his right hand to hit the ball from the right side of his body, it is called a forehand.
If the right-handed player brings his right hand across his body to hit a shot from the left side of his body, it is called a backhand.
The inverse applies for left-handed players.


<h3>Drop shot</h3>

When a player reduces the speed of his shot to land the ball just above the net and onto the opposite side, it is called a drop shot.
A drop shot is generally used when the opposing player is standing at the baseline and it becomes difficult for them to recover a drop shot as they have to cover quite a distance.

<h3>Smash</h3>

When a player hits a shot with all their power, generally from over their heads, such that the opposing player is unable to reach the ball, it is known as a smash.

<h3>Slice</h3>

A player hits a slice when they cut the ball with the racket facing the court at a cross angle. 
The slice is generally used to slow down the pace of a rally.
