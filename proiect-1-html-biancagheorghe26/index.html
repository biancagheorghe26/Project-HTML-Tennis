          Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a
          single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each
          (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord
          to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net
          and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre
          the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid
          return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not
          gain a point, while the opposite player will.

    <h2>More information</h2>
    <p>
      While tennis can be enjoyed by players of practically any level of skill, top competition is a demanding test of both shot making and stamina, 
      rich in stylistic and strategic variety.
       From its origins as a garden-party game for ladies in whalebone corsets and starched petticoats and men in long white flannels,
        it has evolved into a physical chess match in which players attack and defend, exploiting angles and technical weaknesses with strokes of widely diverse pace and spin. 
      Tournaments offer tens of millions of dollars in prize money annually.</p>
